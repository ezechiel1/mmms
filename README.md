### Introduction
Solglobal Money Mutuality Management System (MMMS) is a web application developed for Money Mutuality Organizations to facilitate their money management activities. We realize that many organizations of monetary mutuality always use papers, files, calculators, books to manage their commercial activities, which makes very difficult their operations, no follow-up, as well as the clarity of the operations,â€¦ MMMS will allow the main administrator to manage each member (register, edit, delete, activate or deactivate) by creating an account for each, will help manage contributions, loan of money and reimbursement of members. MMMS will help each member once connected, to follow its activities, its operations (contribution, loan of money, reimbursement) and also confirm the validity of its operations.
